**E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis: Customer Behavior and Sales Trends**

This project aims to analyze e-commerce sales data to understand customer behavior and sales trends.
Using Python and various data analysis libraries, RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and customer segmentation were performed.

**Libraries Used**
**Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis
**Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization
**datetime:** For date operations
**tabulate:** To display segmentation results in tabular format


**Analysis Steps**
**Data Cleaning:** Missing values and canceled orders were removed.
**Total Sales Calculation:** The total sales per product were calculated.
**RFM Analysis:** Customers' recency (last purchase date), frequency (order frequency), and monetary (spending amount) metrics were calculated, and customers were segmented accordingly.

**Segmentation:** Customers were segmented based on their RFM score (e.g., new customers, loyal customers, at-risk customers, etc.).

**Visualization:** Segment distributions and average RFM metrics were visualized. Additionally, return rates and top-selling products were analyzed and visualized.

**Outputs**
**RFM Segmentation:** Customers were categorized into different segments, and an analysis of each segment was performed.
**Heatmap:** The numerical distribution of RFM segments was visualized.
**Segment Distribution:** The distribution of segments was visualized as a pie chart.
